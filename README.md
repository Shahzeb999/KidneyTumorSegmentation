# Kidney Tumor Segmentation using Attention U-Net Model

Welcome to the Kidney Tumor Segmentation project using the Attention U-Net model! This project focuses on segmenting kidney tumors from medical images using deep learning techniques. The Attention U-Net architecture has been employed to achieve accurate and precise tumor segmentation on the KiTS19 dataset.


## Introduction
Kidney tumor segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning. This project demonstrates the application of the Attention U-Net model for accurately segmenting kidney tumors from medical images. The Attention U-Net architecture combines the benefits of the U-Net model with attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions, enhancing segmentation performance.

## Dataset
The [KiTS19 dataset](https://kits19.grand-challenge.org/) is used for training and evaluating the model. This dataset provides 3D CT scans of kidneys along with manual tumor segmentations. Make sure to download and preprocess the dataset before proceeding with the code.
## Results
The trained Attention U-Net model achieves state-of-the-art performance in kidney tumor segmentation. Precise and accurate tumor segmentation results can be observed in the visualizations.
